Attempt to discard a [`event!char`] event that may follow a [`event!key`] event.
This attempts to flush the event queue via a timer, stopping early if we observe
another key or char event.
We flush the event queue by waiting a single tick. It is technically possible
the key and char events will be delivered in different ticks, but it should be
very rare, and not worth adding extra delay for.
