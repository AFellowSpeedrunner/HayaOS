CraftOS-PC Mobile has a number of gestures and shortcuts for navigation and to replace keys that don't exist on the on-screen keyboard.
All gestures are done with two fingers to avoid confusion with one-finger taps/drags, which are sent as mouse events.

* Tap anywhere on the screen with two fingers to open or close the navigation bar.
  * To toggle the keyboard, press the keyboard button in the navigation bar.
  * The current window can be switched by pressing one of the arrow buttons.
  * The window can also be closed with the X button. This button is disabled if the current window is the only open computer.
* Swipe in any direction with two fingers to press the arrow key in that direction.
  * Both fingers must be in the same line parallel to the direction you're swiping in.
  * Horizontal arrow keys do not work on Android. Please use an alternate soft keyboard with arrow keys built-in.
* On iOS, hold two fingers on any screen edge or corner to hold the arrow key(s) in that direction.
* The hotkey toolbar that appears above the keyboard has various useful keys that are not on the default software keyboard:
  * The Ctrl and Alt keys toggle on and off with each press. The key name is shown in bold when it's on.
  * The Tab key presses and releases Tab.
  * The paste key presses and releases Ctrl+V to paste the contents of the clipboard.
  * The terminate, shutdown, and reboot buttons must be held down for at least a second to activate.
    * On Android, the button will activate immediately after one second.
    * On iOS, the button will not activate until it's released. Unfortunately, due to limitations in iOS, there is no indicator whether the button was held long enough, so it's recommended to hold it for about two seconds to make sure it gets activated.
